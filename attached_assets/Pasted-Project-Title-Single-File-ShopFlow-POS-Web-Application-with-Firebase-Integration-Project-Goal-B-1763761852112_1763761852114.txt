Project Title: Single-File "ShopFlow" POS Web Application with Firebase Integration

Project Goal: Build a complete, modern, and professional landing and web application for a Point-of-Sale (POS) system called "ShopFlow." The entire application (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) must be contained within a single index.html file. No build tools (like Webpack/Vite) or external local CSS/JS files are allowed.

Core Technology Stack:

Structure: Single index.html file.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

Logic: Modern Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Backend: Firebase (Authentication & Firestore) via CDN.

Firebase & Data Architecture (CRITICAL) Initialization:
Use the following global variables for setup (assume these are injected by the host environment): __app_id, __firebase_config, and __initial_auth_token.

Auth Flow: Attempt to sign in using signInWithCustomToken using __initial_auth_token. If undefined, fallback to signInAnonymously.

Standard Auth: Implement UI for Email/Password and Google Sign-In.

Firestore Storage Paths (Strict Adherence Required):

Reviews (Public): Store in /artifacts/{__app_id}/public/data/shopflow_reviews/{documentId}.

User Licenses (Private/Admin): Store in /artifacts/{__app_id}/users/{userId}/shopflow_licenses/{documentId}.

User Profiles: Store in users/{userId} (contains email, role, createdAt).

Real-time Logic:

Use onSnapshot for fetching Reviews and Admin License data to ensure the UI updates instantly without refreshing.

Design & UX Guidelines Aesthetics: Clean, trustworthy SaaS look. Professional Blue (#3b82f6) or Modern Green (#10b981) primary colors. High contrast, plenty of whitespace.
Animations: Implement subtle transitions (fade-ins on scroll, hover effects on buttons/cards) to make the single-file app feel like a premium product.

Responsiveness: Fully responsive design. The Navbar must collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile.

Functional Modules & Sections The application must simulate a Multi-Page Application (SPA) using JavaScript to show/hide sections based on navigation.
A. Global Navigation (Navbar)
Left: "ShopFlow" Logo.

Right: Links for Home, Pricing, Reviews, About Us, Contact.

Auth State Logic:

Logged Out: Show "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons.

Logged In: Show "Dashboard" link and "Logout" button.

Admin User: Show "Admin Panel" link.

B. Home Section (Landing)
Hero: Headline ("The POS System That Grows with Your Business"), Sub-headline, and "Get Started" button (links to Sign Up).

Features: 3-column grid (Easy Inventory, Fast Checkout, Sales Analytics) with icons.

Testimonials: Visual placeholders for 3 customer reviews.

Final CTA: Strong invitation to sign up.

C. Pricing Section (Indian Market Focus)
Currency: All prices in INR (₹).

Tax Disclaimer: Must state "Inclusive of all taxes" next to prices.

Tiers:

Small Business: Up to 3 user accounts, Support replies in 2 days.

Enterprise: Unlimited users, Priority Support (1-day reply).

Note: NO Free tier displayed.

CTA: "Try now for 14-days" (prominent button).

D. Reviews Section (Conditional Access)
Access Rule: Visible ONLY to logged-in users with a valid (active/paid) license found in the Firestore License path.

Submission Form:

Star Rating: Interactive 5-star input (stars turn yellow on selection).

Comment: Text area.

Logic: Saves userId, rating (1-5), and comment to Firestore.

Display Feed:

Real-time list of reviews.

Filters: Tabs for 5 Stars, 4 Stars, etc. Default view: Descending by star count, then date.

E. Admin Panel (Restricted)
Access Rule: Accessible only to the specific Admin user (assume the first user or hardcode a specific Admin ID).

License Management (Functional):

Table displaying all registered users.

Actions:

View Status: (e.g., 'None', 'Small Business', 'Trial').

Modify License: Dropdown to assign 'Small Business' or 'Enterprise'.

Set Expiry: Date picker input.

Revoke: Button to remove license.

Data Sync: Updates must persist to the specific Firestore License path.
